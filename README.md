# oit-fcq

## Purpose:

This repo contains various code scripts that we use for FCQs. This does not include the course audit or NLP scripts. For those, please see their dedicated repositories: oit-an-course-audit and oit-an-nlp 

Current packages:

tidyverse, tidymodels, caret, arrow, and readxl R packages. 

## Requirements

*State data, access, and/or software needed to run this repo, and, if applicable, how to acquire these requirements.*

## How To Run:

*Describe how to:*

  - *run the production pipeline to generate predictions*
  - *view the model evaluations and predictions*
  - *train and re-create the model and evaluations from the raw data.*

To use this repo template:
- Create a repo with this oda-ds-template as a template in a web browser, naming your new project in the form: "project-name-YEAR"
- Clone that repo (locally or in Workbench). 
- If using R, create an R Project in this new repo directory. 
- Create and restore virtual environment
  - If using R: Run renv::restore(lockfile = "renv.lock"), typing 'Y' to the prompts asking if you'd like to activate and install these packages.
  - If using Python: proceed with restoring the Python virtual environment from the py.lock file. 
- Delete the this and italicized text, and fill in this Readme with your project specific info. 
- Make an awesome project!

To add additional commonly used packages to this template renv.lock file:

- Clone the template repo, make it a project, run renv::restore() as above.
- Run renv::install("package_name") to install the packages you'd like to have permanently stored in this template.
- Run renv::snapshot(type = "all") to update the renv.lock file with the newly installed packages.
- Add, commit, and push these changes to the DS-template-2023 repo. 

## Output

*Describe the output of this repo's final pipeline.*

## Notes

*Any additional notes or background information that could be useful.*
