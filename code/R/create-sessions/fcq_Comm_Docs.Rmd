**Batch reports archive update**

Each semester, you’ll receive an email when the batch reports have been added to the shared folder. Designated report administrators can access this folder at any time to download your reports.


We still strongly recommend that you download your files to a secure location within your department, whether that is a server, dedicated drive or folder.

Weekly administrations open on Mondays, and occasionally Tuesdays (for holidays), at 11 a.m., with end dates varying from Friday - Sunday.

Windows for classes are based on the course end date that is listed in CU-SIS. Classes that are evaluated during a weekly administration may be moved to a different administration on request.


**Course auditing**

The course auditing window runs from the first Wednesday through the fourth Wednesday of the audit month (March/June/October). During this period the class roster will update each business day.

If you need to update a course that ends prior to the audit window, contact the FCQ program for assistance. Otherwise, make your changes in CU-SIS and they will get picked up during the course audit.

Remember, the FCQ class roster information is taken directly from CU-SIS. To update class or instructor information, you must make changes in CU-SIS.


**Report administrator updates**

Attached is our current list of report administrators (folks who have access to Campus Labs reports). Please let me know if you need to update any of the information.
